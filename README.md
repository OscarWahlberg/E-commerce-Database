# E-commerce-Database
A simple Database for E-Commerce

Im currently studying software development (JAVA).
In this repository im experimenting with mySQL.
Its a typical schoolbook-example of a e-commerce database, with products, customers, orders and what not.
It seems to do what its supposed to, but im far from experienced enough to find the cracks in the system.
There are plenty of improvements to be done, and once i get the time i will list whats yet to be done.
